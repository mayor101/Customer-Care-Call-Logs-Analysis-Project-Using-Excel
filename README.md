# Customer Care Call Logs Analysis Using Excel

## Project Overview
This project analyzed **customer care call log data** to identify key patterns in **customer satisfaction**, **call duration**, and **representative performance**.  
The dataset included fields such as call duration, customer demographics, purchase amount, and satisfaction ratings.  
The goal was to extract actionable insights to help improve customer service efficiency and client experience.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and structured to ensure data accuracy.  
Key steps included:

- Removing extra header rows and blank cells  
- Correcting inconsistent column names  
- Checking for and removing duplicate entries  
- Converting date fields to the correct format  
- Creating calculated columns such as **“Duration Bucket”** and **“Rounded Rating”**

These steps ensured a clean dataset, ready for reliable insights and visualization.

## Analysis and Insights
Using **Excel tools** such as *Pivot Tables*, *Conditional Formatting*, and *Charts*, the following findings were made:

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Average satisfaction score was **4.2 / 5**, showing high service quality.  
- **Call Duration:** Most calls lasted **1–2 hours**, indicating thorough customer engagement.  
- **Top Representatives:** Representative **R05** handled the highest number of calls (~20% of total).  
- **Purchasing Trends:** Higher satisfaction scores were often linked to larger purchase amounts.  
- **Demographics:** Majority of customers were **male (25–45 years)**, with **Columbus** and **Cleveland** showing the most call activity.



## Dashboard Visualizations
The Excel dashboard included the following visual elements:

- **Bar Chart** – Call counts by representative  
- **Line Chart** – Satisfaction score trends over time  
- **Pie Chart** – Customer distribution by city  
- **Summary Cards** – Average satisfaction score and total purchase value  

These visuals made it easy to track team performance and customer experience in a single view.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed strong customer satisfaction levels and identified key drivers of positive service experiences.  
Using Excel’s built-in tools — including **functions, formulas, PivotTables, and charts** — raw data was transformed into an **interactive dashboard** that supports **data-driven decision-making**.
